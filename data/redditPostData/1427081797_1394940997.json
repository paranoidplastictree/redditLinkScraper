But now it's time to finally consider making the subreddit usable for those using [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/). The reason I put this off is because it's pretty difficult. RES uses custom CSS to deliver it's functionality, and this overrides subreddit styles and often breaks things. It's possible to work and style around this, but it's pretty difficult. I'm working on it, but it will take some time.\n\nI want to call upon those that use RES, this would really help me a lot: if you find a place on RES and the subreddit which don't look right when using RES, post a comment on this thread just telling me what and where the issue is. Providing a link would be *really* helpful, but obviously this isn't possible in some circumstances.\n\nIn order to keep good track of things, I'd ask that you post only one issue per comment, making multiple comments for multiple issues. I may not be able to reply to each one, but be assured that I will look at them all. When something is fixed, I'll remove the comment to keep things clean. Also, I'll post comments here to keep track of issues I'm aware of, I'm not delusional and talking to myself. :D\n\nThank you so much!  \n~/u/icomputertinker",

The Thirty Years war has been raging seemingly forever, beginning in 1618 in the Holy Roman Empire as a coalition of northern Protestant states clashed with the dominions of the House of Habsburg and their Catholic allies. \n\nLens was at this point a fortified town in the Spanish Netherlands captured by the French (who were on the Protestant side although being predominantly Catholic, in the pursuit of their own interests) in 1647. The nobility of the town rebelled against their captors, and so a Spanish Habsburg army regained control with an 18,000 strong army under the leadership of Archduke Leopold of Austria. The French prince Louis de Bourbon assembled an army of 16,000 strong in an attempt to recapture Lens. Although the Spaniards were superior in number, on August the 20th, Louis de Bourbon managed to win a decisive victory and force the Spaniards into retreat. The King of Spain, Philip IV had now lost his main army and could no longer continue the war. The Thirty Years war ended the same year, and by then, the entire population of the Empire had shrunk from 21 million in 1618 to 16 million in 1648 -  the same population the Empire previously had by 1500. The conflict ended with the Peace of Westphalia, recognizing the independence of the Dutch Republic, securing the religious rights of Protestant states within the Holy Roman Empire, and supporting the rise of France as a major European power and the decline of Habsburg dynastic influence over Europe.\n\nSo [imagine](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=fireworksNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D46464600000000000000&amp;g2=battlefieldRPGSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D48490001000026000000&amp;g3=&amp;g4=&amp;g5=) yourself taking part in one of these horrifying battles: stunned by cannonades, terrified by viscious cavalry charges and watching the enemy regiments march steadily towards you - all whilst struggling to load your musket with your frostbitten fingers. It makes me grateful that this bloody era in European history came to an end.",

If there aren't many submissions by the end of the month, I'll extend the deadline into January to make up for the late start. Now, down to business! This month's theme will be very broad. Since this is a festive time, the theme is uplifting, energizing, or other such adjectives that would be associated with the holidays! Basically, we aren't meditating, we aren't trying to fall asleep, we want to be happy, joyful, etc. :) From here on, you know the drill:\n\nSome Rules:\n\n* Do not enter more than two submissions. Use only one.\n* Your top-level comment must contain a submission for the contest. i.e. you mustn't submit a regular \"comment\". If you have any questions you would otherwise post in the comments, don't hesitate to [contact the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMyNoise) about it.\n* Your submission must conform to the theme. This is a bit subjective, and the broadness of the theme will vary, but the moderators will be the judges of that.\n* You can submit entries that you've already posted to the subreddit, but you may not plagiarize someone else's work.\n\nIf you break any of these rules, and I'm sure you wouldn't, you seem like a really nice person, you'll be disqualified from this month's contest. Don't worry, you can always resubmit the next time around.\n\n**What you get if you win:**  \n* A subreddit-wide flair to show how special you are  \n* The ability to choose next month's contest's theme  \n* *One month of reddit gold!*  \n\nWhatever holiday you celebrate at this time of year; Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, etc. go and enjoy it!",

I discount Jungle because I am not even entirely sure that is a bird calling and not a mammal. Also it doesn't fit the same kind of chorus as the other birds) it still doesn't *quite* have that crowded oomph of a dawn chorus. Also, from sound mix standpoint, with already taking up four slots of a SuperGenerator, that does not leave much room for further sound mixes (yes there are the accompanying nature sounds of their own generators but I was considering playing around with other types of noises too).\n\nAlso, from a more personal standpoint, there is a chance that I will be living in the city in the future and I will miss the dawn chorus very much.

You are curled up with a loved one - a parent, friend or lover, it doesn't matter. Your head is resting on their chest and you can hear their heartbeat and their breathing. In one corner of the building, musicians practice on drums and flutes. As your focus drifts lazily away from them you can pick up the sounds of voices from the other side of the fire, talking lowly to themselves.

And it's definitely fun to program and use! I can attest that! It adds variety to sound generators that where already quite complex on their own.\n\nEnjoy the preview, and let me know if it works at your side. It relies on browser-timers, which may behave oddly if you are browsing in another tab...

Decreases CDN cost ;).\n\nSide effects on single gens: Should be no problem. The logic applies to each individual generator, this is not handled by the super gen itself.

This month's contest's subject, as decided by the winner of our [previous month's contest](http://redd.it/2jt7oi), /u/McGovernArts, will be **[Lucid Dreaming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream)/[Out of Body Experiences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-body_experience)**.\n\nIn this contest, you may recount the story of a time you experienced either of these phenomena, with a sound to accompany it; or you can submit a sound combo that you think might help others experience a lucid dream or OBE themselves, along with instructions on how to use the sound.\n\nSome Rules:\n\n* Do not enter more than two submissions. Use only one.\n* Your top-level comment must contain a submission for the contest. i.e. you mustn't submit a regular \"comment\". If you have any questions you would otherwise post in the comments, don't hesitate to [contact the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMyNoise) about it.\n* Your submission must conform to the theme. This is a bit subjective, and the broadness of the theme will vary, but the moderators will be the judges of that.\n* You can submit entries that you've already posted to the subreddit, but you may not plagiarize someone else's work.\n\nIf you break any of these rules, and I'm sure you wouldn't, you seem like a really nice person, you'll be disqualified from this month's contest. Don't worry, you can always resubmit the next time around.\n\n**What you get if you win:**  \n* A subreddit-wide flair to show how special you are  \n* The ability to choose next month's contest's theme  \n* *One month of reddit gold!*  \n\nGood Luck!",

            "selftext": "**Hi there!** Welcome to [/r/myNoise](http://www.reddit.com/r/MyNoise/). First off, if you don't know much about reddit, I'd suggest watching this video before continuing any further, just so you aren't as disoriented. You've looked about, clicked some links and are now ready to post your own content! Before you do, though, please take the time to read through these guidelines to ensure consistency and ease of use through out the subreddit, everywhere and for everybody.\n\n**1. Posting**\n\nWhen posting, we strongly recommend you use a text post, because you can add more text to describe your submission as well as a link. This extra text can be a fictitious story, to help set the mood; or it can be a real story, maybe how this particular sound affected you or improved your experience during your day. At the end of the story, put an empty line, and then the link to your generator or [SuperGen](http://mynoise.net/superGenMaker.php). (Formatted link are best, but not mandatory)\n\nIf you don't have the time to make a write up, or you feel that your submission doesn't need one, you can simply submit a link to your generator or [SuperGen](http://mynoise.net/superGenMaker.php), but be sure to give it the proper...\n\n**2. Link Flair**\n\nWhen browsing this subreddit, we want you to have a consistent experience, with no surprise sounds you regret clicking to. (For example, a very creepy sound right before you want to sleep) For this reason, we have a flair system in place. Each individual link flair provides an at-a-glance view of what the sound represents. If the sound is creepy or unsettling, the flair is red, and if it's soothing or calming, the flair is blue. You also need to specify the mood, e.g. Fantasy, Calm, Eerie, Serene, Abandoned, etc. Preceding that is a letter, S or C, which denotes if your submission is a single generator or a combination of two or more sounds. I realize this may seem confusing, but I promise you'll get the hang of it really fast. Here are some examples: [Combination of generators with a Creepy Mood](http://mynoise.net/Reddit/Red-Creepy.html), and a [Single noise generator with a Calming mood](http://mynoise.net/Reddit/Blue-Calming.html). To set link flair, submit your post, then go to the main index, and click \"flair\" [beside your post's listing](http://mynoise.net/Reddit/Flair.html).\n\n**3. Helping You &amp; Helping Me**\nThe subreddit isn't just a big list of sounds, it's a community! This is why we encourage Helping You and Helping Me posts. For example, if you found a sound that is really good for a specific purpose, you can make a Helping You post (where you are helping the reader) and describe what you've found. On the flip side, if you need help with a particular scenario, be that using the site or looking for just that particular sound, we have Helping Me posts. (Where the community is helping you). These aren't limited to just posting sounds, though, this is for all of myNoise.net. If you're having trouble with something, you can just ask right here with a Helping Me post!\n\nNow, with the Helping posts, we have green link flairs. There you just set a green one, and write if it's a Helping You or Helping Me. [Here's an example](http://mynoise.net/Reddit/Green-Helping.html).\n\n**4. Audio Levels**\n\nA quick section here, please keep the average slider volume in the lower half of the sliders. Nobody likes a really loud noise blasting through their speakers unexpectedly, no matter how soothing said noise is.\n\n**5. Story Content**\n\nLet's keep things clean here, for a post labeled with a blue flair, (Calm post) the story shouldn't exceed a G rating (suitable for all ages.). For a post with a red flair, (Creepy) the story shouldn't exceed PG (Parental Guidence Suggested), and the only thing that should put the post into a PG rating is the sheer creepyness, nothing voilent, graphic, etc. I know all of you wouldn't do that, but just in case. ;)\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThank you for reading through this post. We have to enforce these guidelines, so nobody gets confused or surprised with what they click. If your post has deviated too far from the guidelines, a moderator will leave a quick one-liner about what went wrong in the comments, and then remove it from the listings. Obviously your post doesn't have to line up perfectly with our guidelines, but the moderators draw the line where they see fit. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to send us a message by clicking \"message the moderators\" in the sidebar.\n\nThank you, once again, for conforming to the guidelines to ensure everyone has an enjoyable visit.\n\nHappy Listening!\n\n[/u/icomputertinker](http://www.reddit.com/u/icomputertinker)\n\nP.S.

Sure, we have a great community posting *really* nice sound combinations, but we would like to infuse some action into the subreddit. And so, we will be holding a contest every month, to see who can create the best combo given a certain theme or story. This is how it would work: Each month on the first, there will be a new stickied contest post by yours truly. This will contain the theme (or story), and guidelines for that month's contest. You go ahead and create a combo that you think suits the theme best, and post it in the comments. The comments are in \"contest mode\", which means they will be displayed in a random order, and their scores will not be displayed. This makes it fair. Now comes the fun part: listen to other's submissions, and vote them up if you like them, vote them down if you don't. At the end of the month, contest mode will be switched off, and the winner will be revealed. The winner has the privilege of choosing the theme (or writing the story) for the next month's contest, and they get a nice user flair so everyone knows how special they are.\n\nSome Rules:\n\n* Do not enter more than two submissions. Use only one.\n* Your top-level comment must contain a submission for the contest. i.e. you mustn't submit a regular \"comment\". If you have any questions you would otherwise post in the comments, don't hesitate to [contact the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMyNoise) about it.\n* Your submission must conform to the theme. This is a bit subjective, and the broadness of the theme will vary, but the moderators will be the judges of that.\n* You can submit entries that you've already posted to the subreddit, but you may not plagiarize someone else's work.\n\nIf you break any of these rules, and I'm sure you wouldn't, you seem like a really nice person, you'll be disqualified from this month's contest. Don't worry, you can always resubmit the next time around.\n\nGot all that? Good. This contest will be shorter than the others, because we can't travel back in time to post this on the first of October. I hope you all understand. **This contest's theme will be Halloween.** Make your scariest sound combinations, and submit them below! If you want, you can write a story to go along with it. Thank you all so much, and good luck!\n\n**EDIT!!**  \n*The winner will ALSO receive a month of reddit gold! How's that for incentive!*",

            "selftext": "BEFORE listening to the sound, read these instructions!  Or, feel free to play the noise BRIEFLY just to listen to it, but don't listen for too long without reading the instructions.\n\nThis sound is designed to help raise [kundalini energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini).  Raising too much kundalini can be DANGEROUS!  For real, it can cause well documented long-term mental and physical problems called \"[kundalini syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini_syndrome)\" or \"[chi gong psychosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zou_huo_ru_mo_(medicine))\".  However, this will ONLY happen if you try to \"force\" your way through. \n\nIn order to avoid this trouble, you will find it both helpful and pleasant to listen to the [Adi Shakti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxadib61VBI) mantra while listening.  That will help to \"smooth out\" the feeling. Don't let chanting distract you, you don't have to say it or even follow along, just let it flow away in the background.  (If you have experience with this sort of thing, you should chant the mantra and \"circulate the microcosmic orbit\" while you do this.  If you don't know what that meant, then you don't have the experience I'm talking about.)\n\nWhy would you want to do this dangerous thing?  Allowing the kundalini to rise is healthy and useful if done properly, without forcing it.  Just like exercise, if you try to \"play through the pain\", you run a risk of hurting yourself, but, when done properly, it helps you build physical and emotional strength.  Also, its reputed to help you attain enlightenment and magical super powers, if you're into that kind of thing. :)\n\nSo, what to do?  Sit or stand in a comfortable position with your spine straight.  Classic \"yoga\" sitting postures like lotus are good, but anything where your spine is straight and you are comfortable is fine.  Roll your neck around a few times and wiggle your back until you feel tension release and you are comfortable.  Imagine a string that runs from your perineum, up through the center of your body, through your neck, and out the top of your head.  When the string is perfectly straight, you are in the right position. Take a few deep breaths, and imagine the air filling your entire body, from bottom to top. \n\nWhenever you are ready, [begin the mantra]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxadib61VBI)). There might be a youtube ad before the mantra begins.  Adjust the volume so that you can hear the tone and the mantra, and both are comfortable.  Listen to one complete recitation before beginning the noise.  \n\nThe mantra goes:\n\"Adi Shakti, Adi Shakti, Adi Shakti, Namo Namo!\nSarab Shakti, Sarab Shakti, Sarab Shakti, Namo Namo!\nPrithum Bhagvati, Prithum Bhagvati, Prithum Bhagvati, Namo Namo!\nKundalini Mata Shakti,  Namo Namo!\"\n\nWhich means (sort of; it's hard to translate)\n\"Primal Power, I honor You!\nAll-Encompassing Power, I honor You!\nThat through which Divine Creates, I honor You!\nCreative Power of the Kundalini, Mother of all Mother Power, I honor you!\"\n\nThe recording I have linked to is call and response.  Simply repeat each phrase you hear (along with the chorus).\n\nFirst, listen for the deep cat purr rumble.  Imagine that is the sound at the center of the earth, deep below you, warm and dark and safe.  Breathe deeply in through your nose while imagining energy linked to the sound.  \n\nWhen you feel like you've \"tuned in\" to that noise, listen for the isochronic (the beeping).  Imagine that to be the sound at the center of the universe, out in deep, deep space, way about your head.   Keep breathing slowly and deeply, in through your nose and out through your mouth.\n\nFinally, \"tune in\" to the Shepard tone.  Imagine energy flowing up from teh center of the earth, through your perineum, up your spine, through your neck, through  your thalamus, through your corpus collosum, out through the top of your head, and out, out, out to the center of the universe far above.  It might seem like light or tingling or heat or a buzzing or however you want to imagine \"primal power\".  For me, it feels like this sound.  You might find it helpful to imagine it spiraling as it moves up.  It's ok if you don't see/feel/hear/sense anything at first, just imagine it as well as you can.  With a little time, you'll be able to feel it.\n\nAllow the energy to rise following the tone.  You might feel that it \"gets stuck\" somewhere, or you might find that it just kind peters out part way up.  Take note of those places, but don't worry about them.  Whatever happens, whatever you feel or don't feel, as long as it doesn't hurt, it's all ok.  Don't try to force anything, just keep breathing deeply and slowly, and imagining the upward flow.  \n\nIf it hurts at all, if you have pain in your head or neck especially, STOP THE NOISE, but continue listening to the mantra.  Take several short, quick breaths, and blow out HARD and FAST.  LAUGH!  Just fake laughing until you laugh for real.  When you're done laughing, drink a glass of water.  If you're still feeling wobbly, take a cool, but not uncomfortably cold, shower and eat something solid and simple like rice or crackers.\n\nWhen the mantra is over TURN OFF THE SOUND.  Half an hour is PLENTY.  Don't listen for longer than that.  Drink some water, and then LAUGH.  Dancing would be even better.\n\nYou may find that you need more water and sleep than usual over the next day or two.  Give your body what it asks for.\n\n[Kundalini Rising](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=shepardAudioIllusionToneGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D30003000410043003021&amp;g2=isochronicBrainwaveGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000000240000000000&amp;g3=catPurrNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D31413200000000000000&amp;g4=waterStreamNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000022293215141811&amp;g5=)",

You weren't happy about that, something about *needing* to be on time today, not wanting to miss those vital first few minutes of NASDAQ. You remember seeing the idiot in the Hummer pulling out too soon in front of you, a newspaper folded in his right hand taking his eyes from the road...\n\nWhat you don't remember is ever having seen a place like [this](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=rainNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D49685000001732404100&amp;g2=singingBowlsDroneGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D30303030303030303030&amp;g3=churchAtmosphereSoundGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D86372800553400000000&amp;g4=&amp;g5=), or even how you got there. The lights are dim here, and everything is obscured by something like an indoor fog. The flat, muted color of marble rises on either side of you down the long, long corridor, meeting at a vaulted ceiling that seems as high above you as a low-hanging cloud. You are walking, walking, walking. You feel a chilling breeze stealing towards you from the end of the corridor, but it's so far away you can't even guess where it terminates--or where it leads. The sound of rain is close, though its source is unclear. A steady hum seems responsible for pulling you... pulling you to the end of the corridor. Thinking about the *end* of the corridor is troubling to you, though you're not sure why. No matter, it's so far away it doesn't matter where it leads.\n\nInstead of worrying, you enjoy the rare reprieve from the numbers, mistresses, dollar signs, whiskey, and lies with which your life is filled. For now--at least until the end of the corridor--you are content to simply walk.",

The gray stone and soulless white of your city falls behind as you leave city limits. Fallow fields ready for this season's crops spread out around you, and you wonder again how your life would be different if you had worked outside, with nature, and not as a liaison for corporate excecs who make more in a week than most of the world's workers do in a year.\n\nYou close your eyes, trying to keep your mind off the tedious (and somewhat untruthful) PowerPoint slides, and even worse, the schmoozing that you'll have to engage in the rest of the afternoon. Maybe you can get some sleep; after all, the trip takes hours, and last night... you had some trouble getting back to sleep after that bizarre dream.\n\nThe first thing you notice when you regain consciousness is the sound of birds. Wild birds, tropical even. You know there are no birds that sound like that anywhere nearby, except maybe at an aviary. One look out the window is enough to shock you fully awake. This can't be your train. Red light pours over the massive jungle at sunset. You almost call out for help, but you can faintly hear whispers beyond your private cabin's door. Whoever it is doesn't sound alarmed. For some reason, you don't want them to know you are.\n\nThe train has slowed down. At the window you have time to make out animals as you pass at a lethargic pace. They are unlike any animals you've ever seen. One could almost be a tiger, another is something like an ape, but you know at a glace that they are fundamentally different creatures. Now the train is slowing further. Soon you know it will come to a halt, and you will have to get off.\n\nYou place your briefcase on the seat, almost smiling. Wherever you are going, you won't be needing it.\n\n",

As you breathe in, remember that the air you are breathing surrounds the earth, connecting you to everything else that draws breath.   Breathe out, letting your body empty of all tension and worry.  Breathe in, feeling your whole body fill up like a balloon.  Feel the life-sustaining oxygen permeate every cell of your body.  Breathe out, feeling all the waste and toxins exit your body with your breath.  You\u2019ll  notice that as you breathe slowly and deeply, your heart begins to beat more slowly.  As you feel your body slowing down, you\u2019ll feel yourself sinking deeper and deeper into trance.  \n\nAllow your breathing to make a circle, in and out, with no stops and starts,   The cycle of your breath connects you to all other living things.  The oxygen you breathe in was breathed out by the trees.  Your exhalations are the air they breathe in, a perfect and eternal circle.  The deeper you breathe, the slower your heart beats.  The slower it beats, the deeper you go.  The deeper you go, the better it feels, and it feels so good. \n\nImagine what it would be like to close your eyes, and melt deeper into the warm darkness.  The darkness embraces you like a quilt, warm and soft.  You feel safe and secure, warm and relaxed.  You see a set of stairs, leading down into the earth.  There are seven stairs.  With each step you descend, you know you\u2019ll feel yourself sinking further and further into a calm, relaxed, safe trance.  You know when you reach the last stair, you\u2019ll be completely relaxed, completely warm, completely safe.  It feels so good, you take a step down.  After the first step, you\u2019re 10 times more relaxed that you were, just a moment ago.  \n\nDescend the second step.  You\u2019re enveloped in warmth and safety, and you feel yourself sinking deep into a magical trance.  As you continue to breathe deeply, step down the third step.  You can feel your whole body relax.  Thee deeper you go, the better it feels.  The better it feels, the deeper you go.\n\nYou take another step down.  After this fourth step, you feel so warm and happy that a smile spreads across your face.  The smile is made out of pure joy, and you can feel it permeating every cell of your body with a happy, warm glow.\n\nStepping down the fifth step, you feel yourself more relaxed than you knew was possible.  You\u2019re in a very deep magical trance now.  Isn\u2019t it amazing how easy it was?  All you have to do is breathe deeply and listen to the sound of my voice, guiding you down this staircase.  \n\nYou take the sixth step down.  The deeper you go, the better it feels.  The better it feels, the deeper you go.  You\u2019re nearly at the bottom now, and you can feel that, in this place, anything is possible.  You\u2019re in a very deep trance state.  Your breathing and heart rate are very slow right now, and all you feel is the joyful embrace of the warm darkness.  The deeper you go, the better it feels.  The better it feels, the deeper you go.\n\nYou take the seventh, the final, step down, and you are as relaxed as it possible for you to be at this time.  You\u2019re in a completely magical state.  All the boundaries between thought and action are relaxed.  It feels good and right.  You\u2019ve always had this place inside of you, and you know that you\u2019ll be able to reach it anytime you like, just by walking down these seven stairs.\n\nYou realize that you are deep inside a mountain, in a cave which is your home.  You are deep, deep within the womb of the earth.  You can feel the pull of gravity on your body, helping you to sink deeper and deeper into the deep, warm darkness at the center of the earth.  As you sink deeper and deeper, you realize that your body has grown huge.  You can feel yourself coiled up like a serpent, like a dragon.  Feel the warmth beneath you, like a rock baked in the sun, like a dragon\u2019s hoard.  Take a deep breath and feel the caverns of your lungs expand.  \n\nYou can feel your skin, tight and scaly.  Feel the root of your body, the firm foundation that connects you to the earth.  Begin to unccoil, feeling your body unwind.  You may feel a stiffness in your hips as you do.  As you uncoil your dragon body, you\u2019ll feel the stiffness loosen.  Stretch your scaly body, feel it ripple as it awakens inside of you.  You may feel a wave of energy slowly rise up your spine.  Feel your wings taking shape, slowly unfurling from your shoulders.\n\nYou can see a red glow coming from the mouth of your cave.  Moving towards the opening, take a deep breath, stoking the fire within you.  Exhale in a series of short bursts, priming your flame.  Take another deep breath in, and emerge from your cave.  As you exhale, spread your wings, and breath out a great gust of fire.  \n\nFeel the sensation of flying, pumping your wings to soar on the air.  Take another deep breath in, and prime your fire by exhaling in short bursts. ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haaaaaaaaaa.  You may find that there are some dry, tight, itchy spots on your scales.  Turning your head, you can see that barnacles have begun to grow on you, and that\u2019s what\u2019s making you itch.\n\nTurn your head and breath fire onto them.  It won\u2019t hurt you; dragons are impervious to their own fire.  You\u2019ll feel a sensation of warmth as all the itchy barnacles burn off, leaving shiny new scales beneath.  It feels so good.  The better it feels, the higher your soar.  The higher you soar, the better it feels.  When you\u2019ve burned off all the barnacles that you can, take another deep, deep breath, and breath out a giant gout of flame, celebrating your new freedom. \n\nWhenever you\u2019re ready, head back to your cave inside the mountain.  Take a deep breath in, and let it all flow out of you, like a river.   Whenever you\u2019re ready, lie down inside your cave, and coil your dragon body back up to take a nap.  As your dragon relaxes, you can feel yourself reentering your own body, your human body.  You may feel some stiffness at first, but as you stretch, you feel alert and refreshed.  You might feel your body slipping into a new alignment, now that you\u2019ve removed the impediments to your energy.  Whenever you\u2019re ready, open your eyes, feeling refreshed and alert.  ",

It's IMPORTANT to set the timer on the first sound (the isochronic tone) to somewhere between 30 and 60.  Also, the lucid dream won't occur as long as the tone is playing (probably; I can't guarantee anything).  Depending on your speakers, you may also want to turn the isochronic down.  Don't turn it up; it should be barely audible over the Tibetan drone.",

Lavender is Auriel (the enlightener).\n\nIf you've never done any work with the angels, try listening with your eyes closed, and imagining the angels surrounding you; Michael on your right, Gabriel on your left, Auriel ahead of you, and Raphael behind you.\n\nIf you have some experience in this sort of thing, this sound is specifically designed for the LBRP (or the GRH).  If you don't know what I'm talking about but want to, read this [blog post](http://traifbanquet.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-lbrp_28.html)\n\nYou can use it for other angelic work as well.

But in the recent years of my life, I've been appreciating autumn a lot more, and it has become my favourite out of the four. Not because of the colours, the leaves, the weather, etc. but because of the feeling of clarity it provides. It puts things in perspective, which is needed after two whole months of summer and less responsibilities. During the summer, school is closed; I don't need to worry about homework, tests, or even waking up early. I can do really whatever I want. When autumn arrives, though, it brings with it the start of a new school year, responsibilities, homework, tests, and a blaring alarm clock that goes off at six in the morning. (ouch!) Despite these negative aspects, I like the autumn because it phases out chaos, laziness, and other negative aspects of summer, and brings reassuring schedules, routines, and predictability. I always find myself taking a stroll through parks by the seashore, with a cup of hot coffee and mittens on my hands, looking at the nice colours of the trees an listening to the waves. Autumn is now my favourite season not because of the superficial (albeit enjoyable) aspects, such as falling red and orange leaves, piles of them that you jump into, rainier days, and the early morning mist and dew, but more what events these details precede. The levelheadedness, clarity, and responsibility.*\n\n[Listen to the generator here.](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=springWalkSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D23300000001600000000&amp;g2=oceanNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000000322824201611&amp;g3=&amp;g4=&amp;g5=)",

            "is_self": true,
            "selftext": "**Hi there!** Welcome to /r/myNoise. First off, if you don't know much about reddit, I'd suggest watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLSKUhDnoJjYn0TV9V84C4Wr2DjKPc492c&amp;amp;amp;v=pU7dhH15CgE) video before continuing any further, just so you aren't as disoriented. You've looked about, clicked some links and are now ready to post your own content! Before you do, though, please take the time to read through these guidelines to ensure consistency and ease of use through out the subreddit, everywhere and for everybody.\n\n**1. Posting**\n\nWhen posting, we strongly recommend you use a text post, because you can add more text to describe your submission as well as a link. This extra text can be a fictitious story, to help set the mood; or it can be a real story, maybe how this particular sound affected you or improved your experience during your day. At the end of the story, add a new line, and then the link to your generator or [SuperGen](http://mynoise.net/superGenMaker.php). (Formatted link are best, but not mandatory) If you need help with any formatting, such as new lines and links, click \"formatting help\" at the bottom of the submissions box.\n\nIf you don't have the time to make a write up, or you feel that your submission doesn't need one, you can simply submit a link to your generator or [SuperGen](http://mynoise.net/superGenMaker.php), but be sure to give it the proper...\n\n**2. Link Flair**\n\nWhen browsing this subreddit, we want you to have a consistent experience, with no surprise sounds you regret clicking to. (For example, a very creepy sound right before you want to sleep) For this reason, we have a flair system in place. Each individual link flair provides an at-a-glance view of what the sound represents. If the sound is creepy or unsettling, the flair is red, and if it's soothing or calming, the flair is blue. You also need to specify the mood, e.g. Fantasy, Calm, Eerie, Serene, Abandoned, etc. Preceding that is a letter, S or C, which denotes if your submission is a single generator or a combination of two or more sounds. I realize this may seem confusing, but I promise you'll get the hang of it really fast. Here are some examples: [Combination of generators with a Creepy Mood](http://mynoise.net/Reddit/Red-Creepy.html), and a [Single noise generator with a Calming mood](http://mynoise.net/Reddit/Blue-Calming.html). To set link flair, submit your post, then go to the main index, and click \"flair\" [beside your post's listing](http://mynoise.net/Reddit/Flair.html).\n\n**3. Helping You &amp;amp;amp; Helping Me**\nThe subreddit isn't just a big list of sounds, it's a community! This is why we encourage Helping You and Helping Me posts. For example, if you found a sound that is really good for a specific purpose, you can make a Helping You post (where you are helping the reader) and describe what you've found. On the flip side, if you need help with a particular scenario, be that using the site or looking for *just that particular sound*, we have Helping Me posts. (Where the community is helping *you*). These aren't limited to just posting sounds, though, this is for all of myNoise.net. If you're having trouble with something, you can just ask right here with a Helping Me post!\n\nNow, with the Helping posts, we have green link flairs. There you just set a green one, and write if it's a Helping You or Helping Me. [Here's an example.](http://mynoise.net/Reddit/Green-Helping.html)\n\n**4. General Discussion Posts**\n\nSince this is a community, we encourage general discussion of myNoise.net! Make a text post, and speak your mind. Please keep it centred on myNoise.net, the subreddit, or the sound generators. After you're done, add a green flair to your submission. You don't need to change the default text, the flair should say \"General\".\n\n**5. Audio Levels**\n\nA quick section here, please keep the average slider volume in the lower half of the sliders. Nobody likes a really loud noise blasting through their speakers unexpectedly, no matter how soothing said noise is. A good rule of thumb is to keep the average slider settings in the bottom half, but sometimes this too can produce really loud sounds. Keep in mind that a quiet sound people have to turn up is in all cases better than a loud sound they have to turn down.\n\n**6. Story Content**\n\nLet's keep things clean here, for a post labeled with a blue flair, (Calm post) the story shouldn't exceed a G rating (suitable for all ages.). For a post with a red flair, (Creepy) the story shouldn't exceed PG (Parental Guidence Suggested), and the *only* thing that should put the post into a PG rating is the sheer creepyness, nothing voilent, graphic, etc. I know all of you wouldn't do that, but just in case. ;)\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nThank you for reading through this post. We have to enforce these guidelines, so nobody gets confused or surprised with what they click. If your post has deviated too far from the guidelines, a moderator will leave a quick one-liner about what went wrong in the comments, and then remove it from the listings. Obviously your post doesn't have to line up *perfectly* with our guidelines, but the moderators draw the line where they see fit. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to send us a message by clicking \"message the moderators\" in the sidebar.\n\nThank you, once again, for conforming to the guidelines to ensure everyone has an enjoyable visit.\n\nHappy Listening!\n\n/u/icomputertinker\n\nP.S.\nIf you need to talk with the creator of myNoise.net, Stephane, you can message him on reddit, he is /u/audiosampling, or you can [solve this simple CAPTCHA](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01OnIzpWM4TO9TjNEcQv0qOQ==&amp;amp;amp;c=F_cLMfy6bWHgTD7Z6ZH8OKWdrySwNMchWfgizcSBacI=) to see his email address.
