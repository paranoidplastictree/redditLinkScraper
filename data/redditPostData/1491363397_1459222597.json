Consider it in pennies per minute of use.  \nI contribute $40.00/yr, and use MyNoise at least 5 hours per week.  40 bucks for 250 hours, or about 3.75 minutes per penny.

The basic app alone is very impressive but on my phone there are intermittent crackles and popping noises that spoil it.  It sounds like occasional radio interference. I'm using the app offline BTW.\n\nI have asked the maker of the app and they said it is a power-hungry app and they will look into a low-power option for older phones.  I have an Alcatel Pixi 3 (4.5) which plays all the other sound/noise apps I have loaded, no problem at all. Its not an old phone, really.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else has had this problem and if there is anything I could do to fix it myself? None of the other apps I've tried had this problem, in fact I've never heard of glitches like this due to low power before . . . . \n\nIs there a way round it or do I have to wait until the maker fixes the problem in an update (maybe) or I buy a better phone?",

I am posting my first ever supergen that I consider able to be shared as a celebration of my laptop finally getting the piece it needed to play this site at FULL HD and without crashing my system.\n\nSo with that being said, here is my new custom sound. This one is very simple but useful for me as I work from home and one of my flatmates, while a good lad, is somewhat LOUD when he comes home from his job. He also has a somewhat...tenuous grasp of certain social graces. So having a noise for when I need to block out things and work is essential.\n\n[Here](https://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=dataCenterNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D0021000012000000100000%26m%3D&amp;g2=binauralBrainwaveGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D1300000000130013000000%26m%3D&amp;g3=binauralBrainwaveGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D1100000000000011001100%26m%3D&amp;g4=&amp;g5=&amp;yt=) it is. The top noise is the server room mask and I like it because it's very deep for my hearing calibration but you can flatten the low end to match the other two sliders if you prefer. The middle noise and last noises are binaural blends. The first is for relaxation, the second is for focus.\n\nTo use this noise for work, set your headphone level on your computer to about halfway and then adjust the level of the binaurals to just audible with comfort. Then raise the level of the server room on top to mask the entire noise. Proceed with work thusly.\n\nI work in transcription and transcription review so having a noise that allows my work to be heard over it while still blocking out ambient noise from outside is priceless. Thank you, Stephane, for making such a site possible. I hope all use this noise and tell me good feedback on how to improve it. I'll be posting other custom noises soon as I've been using them in my self-hypnosis practice...but that's for another day. ;D Ciao!",

I'm also not sure if audicty would cover the wide range of frequencies since apparently apart of how these noise generators work is that they play sounds in a very wide range of frequencies.\n\nI'm planning to donate to the website no matter what I do (this website is amazing).

This realm, hidden the the shadow of the ever-fleeting Phantom Mountain, for which Treebeard, the most ancient of the Ent race, searched hopelessly. Never did the Entwives in their exodus expect to be discovered; let alone by such an unlikely pair of travelers...\n\nFollowing a long, fruitless excursion into unseen, uncharted depths, Gimli and Legolas emerged from the gaping maw of the cavern. Through merciless darkness, they had followed the soft voice of the stream, which seemed to spring from the heart of the mountain itself. It was warm; warm as the very life-blood of the earth. Even the dead rock over which it flowed could not cool its vigor.\n\nAs the travelers emerged from the blackness of the mountain's throat, their eyes strained at the full moon, for it was the first light they had met since their torch last burned days ago. The ever-warm, precious stream flowed into the night beyond them. Gimli and Legolas rejoiced at their victory, free into the world once again. But nevertheless, they could not dismiss a faint sense of foreboding.\n\nThey wondered at where they were. Indeed, no lore spoke of the lands beyond the Phantom Mountain, upon which no man had set foot. Before them was a great, dark forest, from which seemed to emanate a strong power; gentle, potent, and old. Very old. Legolas was reminded of the Forest Fangorn. There was no such malevolence here, but he felt this forest no less watchful. The canopy above the dark wood glistened in the moonlight. A fog rested atop the meandering, knotted tree roots; a fog that seemed to glow by some curious inner light. Voices hung in the air. Whispers among the trees.\n\n\"Shall we enter?\" Legolas asked.\n\n\"Well we shan't go back!\" Gimli replied. \"I've had enough darkness and despair in forsaken caverns. Alas, this wood seems not very inviting. Do you think it to be perilous?\"\n\n\"I see no danger here, nor do I sense ill will. But be we should be wary nonetheless.\" His elf eyes peered far into the darkness. His vision was clouded, as if by some enchanted, protecting veil. He turned to Gimli. \"Shall I lead this time?\" he asked with a grin.\n\n\"Rgh... Aye, elf. Go on then.\" Gimli retorted. His pride, after his dwarf instincts failed him in the caves, was somewhat dulled.\n\n\"Very well, my friend. Step lightly, and keep your axe on your belt. We are being watched. And discussed...\"\n\n[The Domain of the Entwives](https://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=isabelleKnightHypnosisTalkGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D4933304444313744443100%26m%3D&amp;g2=singingBowlsDroneGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D0021210022280000003300%26m%3D&amp;g3=enchantedForestSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D3646393331293229363200%26m%3D&amp;g4=magicWaterStreamGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D2221261725262726192500%26m%3DMEADOW0~MEADOW2~MEADOW3~STREAM6~WINTER6~WATERSPRING7~CAVEWATER8~STREAM8~STREAM9~WATERSPRING9&amp;g5=stardustDroneGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D2625253225252523000000%26m%3D&amp;yt=)",

Every night, I connect my phone to a Bluetooth speaker and play one of the various rain sound generators while my SO and I sleep.\n\nLast night, the app stopped working. I connected to the Bluetooth and hit play, but no sound. When I turned the volume all the way up and put my ear right up against the Bluetooth speaker, instead of rain I heard a generic error noise, similar to [this one on YouTube](https://youtu.be/OtqdbS0YFvo) (I had to search to find something that sounded like what I heard, this is what I found).\n\nI switched between various generators, same noise. I tried deleting my favorite generator and downloading it again, same noise. I tried playing music through the Music app, and that played over the Bluetooth speaker without an issue. I turned off Bluetooth and tried to run MyNoise using the built-in iPhone speaker, and I got the same noise, but a little louder. Music over the built-in speaker played just fine, as did ringtones.\n\nAnother odd thing: the MyNoise app appears to be *generating* this noise. When I play with the EQ sliders in the app, the pitch changes as if this was a deliberate generator, working as intended. But hitting stop on the app does not stop the noise; I have to hard-close the app to get the noise to stop.\n\nSo to sum up: as of last night, the MyNoise app now generates only that error noise, both over BlueTooth speaker and using the built-in phone speaker. The EQ sliders work on the noise to increase or decrease pitch, just as the app would normally work, but the stop button does not stop the noise. Other sounds, such as music and ringtones, work just fine.\n\nSuch a strange error. Has anyone reported anything like this? Are the devs able to give me any guidance on this? Thanks.\n\nEdited to add: I deleted the app and redownloaded it, then restored purchases. One of the generators worked (I hadn't tested that generator before reinstalling, so no clue if it worked before) but the others still have the same problem.",

I think it gives off a soothing 'buzz' of people talking, radio-chatter and artillery in the distance.\nIt makes me feel like I'm sitting in Airforce One with a bunch of generals with concerned looks on their faces, looking out at distant AA fire and shelling.",

It's faster, more battery-efficient, and the audio files we use are even higher-quality than the website or the iOS app! \n\n##Reporting Issues##\n\n* Using our: [Bug Tracker](https://bitbucket.org/myNoise/mynoise.android/issues?status=new&amp;status=open)\n* Emailing [the dev](mailto://android-app@mynoise.net)\n* Twittering: [the dev](https://twitter.com/nsmustache)\n\nThank you for your understanding, we have our sights on beta 3 with support for downloadable generators, saved presets and smarter battery use.\n\n##Things to test##\n\n* Audio quality\n    * Do you hear pops?\n    * Any wave effect?\n    * Is the volume too loud? Too quiet?\n    * Can you hear proper stereo separation with headphones?\n* Battery use\n    * Does the phone get hot?\n    * if you leave the app overnight (even without sound playing) does it drain battery?\n* Crashes\n    * Please don't be angry when we crash :)\n    * Feel free to `monkey-test` the app by pressing all the buttons.\n\nI know some of you rely on the app for their daily routine, so I am sorry if I broke anything.\n\nBeta 3 should be available within two weeks;  sooner if we find a top priority bug that we can fix.\n",

I was trying to develop a new blend this morning for work from home and veered off into a trance mix that I'm blending for hypnotherapy work on myself. I'll be posting some links for those w/instructions soon as they are really, REALLY effective. REALLY.\n\nBut to the issue at hand, I'm using the new brainwave noise in this new mix, Neuromodulator, with Perception Cloud and a custom binural brainwave set. Three noises, shouldn't be a big deal, right? Wrong. Have NOT YET ONCE got it to load. And I think I know why.\n\nResource apps on Chrome, in general, tend to suck a lot of memory. And my laptop I'm working on right now is very, very underpowered in the RAM and video departments, even running Ubuntu 16.04. So I think the main issue is just that as the code for Chrome gets better, it handles more and more of these bigger memory usage noises easier. Of course, I'm getting more RAM for this laptop ASAP so I'll report back when that happens.\n\nBut in the interim, are there any hacks we can do to Chrome to lessen the load on the browser itself? Maybe a Patreon for code improvements to play nice with Chrome? I'll throw in some BitCoin for that. TIA.",

They have the little circle saying it's going to load then does nothing for several minutes. I turn the screen off and back on again and it opens to the app still trying to load but then quickly turns the app off and goes to desktop.\n\nNo warnings or error messages occur, and it doesn't matter if the generator is new or old. I've also had problems with multi-gen's playing then having the app crash within a few minutes of playing it.\n\nI've tried uninstalling the app from my iPod touch and reinstalling it, right now I've just deleted all local content and trying to reinstall the gen's to see if that helps, but other than that I don't know what else to do. I prefer using multi-generators simply because I get more sounds from it, and hope there is a way to fix this.",

            "selftext": "* Anyone with a Mac can do this.\n* You don't need knowledge of coding or any third-party software whatsoever.\n* What this code does is, it **opens your favorite MyNoise generator as a minified player in Safari, then minimizes the window** so it's out of your way. \n\nI've been creating audiovisual contexts to help me out with everyday life, and I recently included MyNoise. Why'd that be useful? Well, now what I need sits in the Mac's menu bar, and all it takes for my favorite MyNoise mix to start up and get out of the way is two mouse clicks and an average time of 5 seconds. If you use MyNoise a lot, this can really make a big difference in getting to study or relax quicker, and avoiding exposure to too much information when you should stay focused. \n\n\n\n**Preparing MyNoise**\n\n1. Create your favorite MyNoise mix. You can use single sound generators or make a supergenerator. \n\n2. From MyNoise's settings menu, hit \"Save in URL\" and \"Clone as Minified Player\".\n\n3. Copy the minified player's address.\n\n\n\n\n**Making the code**\n\n\n1. Open an application called Script Editor, located in Applications/Utilities. Paste in [the following 11-row script.](http://pastebin.com/pgVL8xyt)\n\n2. Where the code says PASTEADDRESSHERE, obviously, replace that with the address of the minified player that you just created. \n\n3. From the buttons in the top bar of Script Editor, click the *hammer* button. This compiles the script into usable form, and if there are no errors, it should gain colors and not give up any pop-up messages about errors.\n\n4. Save this script into Users/YOURNAME/Library/Scripts , and in the saving window's lower part, choose \"Application\" for the File Format. (If the file format is Script, in most contexts it means that when you open that file, it opens it in Script Editor app. If you save it as Application format, opening the file then results into the script being run.)\n\n5. Open Script Editor's preferences. On the first tab that comes up, tick \"Show Script menu in menu bar\" and \"Show Computer scripts\". This should bring a little script icon to sit in your menu bar, top right. Clicking that, you should see your newly created MyNoise script there, ready to activate upon clicking!\n\n\nIf you find yourself creating multiple scripts that open different MyNoise generators, it's possible to create sub-folders to Users/YOURNAME/Library/Scripts, and they will show up in the menu bar's script menu just fine. \n\n*Note: The code usually minimizes the window before the sound generator has loaded the sounds, but that's not anything to worry about, because the sound playback will start when it's ready despite of the window already being hidden. If you think that your computer can handle it and the waiting delay time inside the code (5 seconds) is excessively long, you can replace the \"delay 5\" part in the code with a smaller number, representing seconds. I entered 5 just in case, because sometimes giving too many commands at too short intervals results into a sort of hiccup and the script fails to execute every step written in it.*\n\nEXTRA:\nToo many browser tabs open, don't want to browse around to find the MyNoise window when you want to get rid of it? Want silence asap? Here's an extra script which **finds a tab in Safari containing \"MyNoise\" in the title, then closes it**.\n*Note: This closes ANY Safari window whose title contains \"MyNoise\". So if you happen to have this Reddit site open for example, this script would close it.*\n\n[Here it is, 11 rows of script.](http://pastebin.com/1BFjuTNy)",
