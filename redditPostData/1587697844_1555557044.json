Why? Because now that I've learned some new tricks, I've been able to execute the simple yet powerful concept I've had in mind much better than before. The most important change are the drums - while the *African Trance* (which I originally used) is a very good and versatile generator, it didn't really allow me to set the exact mood I was going for - I just settled for it back then due to lack of options when it comes to drum generators on myNoise. I knew, of course, about the beautiful taiko drum loop from *Cinematic East* (one of my favorite soundscapes on myNoise!) but it was just too fast and frenetic for the \"focused but relaxed\" state of mind that I had been trying to induce with this generator...\n\nWhat I didn't know was that I could have used note transposition to slow it down - which is exactly what I did now - and it makes all the difference!\n\nI used the same thing to alter the throat singing drone a little (achieving deeper and better sound IMO) and I also replaced the rain generator and added some subtle rainforest ambience. All in all, now it sounds the way I wanted it to sound from the start! :)\n\nP.S.: Here's the [**old version**](https://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=polyrhythmBeatGenerator.php%3Fc%3D1%26l%3D40205560004000000000%26a%3D1%26am%3D7%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;g2=throatSingingDroneGenerator.php%3Fc%3D1%26l%3D18304147504744403327%26a%3D1%26am%3D1%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;g3=rainNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D1%26l%3D22130912263549514132%26a%3D1%26am%3D2%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;g4=&amp;g5=&amp;yt=) for anyone interested.",

Also, finding the way to loop the song nicely (so there would be no audible gap when going back to start) was a challenge but I think it works perfectly :) (I didn't want to rely on a YouTube video with the song already looped as these tend to get deleted due to copyright claims quite often.)

I've slept to just these in combination the past few nights, and it's been really awesome, but I see the potential for adding more sound to this combo. There seems to be something faint that sounds like distant walking on something maybe slushy or metal, a crackling of beads or pebbles, and some kind of a windy element embedded into this combination already, so I could maybe imagine a bit of the fireplace generator, one of the wind or rain ones, the sky walker one, parts of Winter Walk or Polar Expedition, one of the running water or ocean generators, or even parts of the aircraft or that one whose name I can't remember off the top of my head that has the starship ambience going with this. The tonal quality of the initial combination has a lonely or serene feeling to it, so settings I've thought of so far have been a continuing voyage aboard a starship on a long or not urgent journey, an excursion using a spacesuit, either outside a starship or space station, or maybe being in temporary orbit of a planet, standing or sitting on a hostile or habitable planet with no life on it except for just you, flying in the skies of Earth or an imagined planet, barren rock, ice, or other landscape below, some kind of weather accompanying what ever it is one is doing on this planet... I'm glad I could share this, and I look forward to seeing where this initial start leads us in creating multi or supergens.",

Join the chant, singing any notes that you feel like trying out. Concentrating on what the resonance of your own voice feels like helps you to fade out unnecessary wandering thoughts, gently wake up the voice, melt away tension, and invite focus to the actual singing rehearsal space. After 10 minutes or so, you'll be ready to proceed to more structured vocal warmups or start singing songs.\n\n[/U/ Session](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/custom.php?l=53535553595353544554&amp;m=HUUCHANT0~HUUCHANT1~THROAT1~HUUCHANT2~THROAT2~HUUCHANT3~HUUCHANT4~ENLIA6~ELGREY6~HUUCHANT8&amp;d=0&amp;title=/u/%20Session)",

Most rain washes away sin, but an LA winter storm only drives home the accusation, so I ducked into a cafe and took a window seat to wait out the worst of the rain. I watched the colors of light dance as they played off the water droplets on the window, and the cars passed by.\n\nThe afternoon darkened. I didn't notice.\n\nThe cigarette burned out. I didn't notice that either.\n\nI hadn't even touched my cup of coffee by the time it cooled off.\n\nI couldn't stop wondering what Velma was thinking in those last days. She had come a long way.

Nothing special or extra original on my side here - I got the idea of pairing it with **Northern Lights** from another myNoise user's testimonial under Implanted Memories, pairing it with **Slow Motion** was also kind of obvious choice as it's a tribute to Vangelis on its own - and you can never go wrong with a little bit of rain (especially when trying to emphasize a Blade Runner mood) :) Anyway, it definitely does the trick of making the original generator little richer in terms of sound variability and ambience - in a single browser tab - which was really all that I was aiming for here...

It was unsettling enough reading about the descriptions of unease experienced by the colonists as they had to deal with their first incidents of threadfall. They thought quickly and came up with means to survive this deadly menace, though, so this is my take on what things might have been like even once they got used to dealing with thread.\n\nA new pass has begun. It's been 250 years since the menace of thread descended onto Pern. You've been skeptical your whole life. You had thought the dragons and their riders had helped defend against the frightening danger for the last time some two and a half centuries ago, and that the threat was gone forever. A dragon and its rider had arrived a few days ago to give a confirmatory warning to your hold's leaders that the new pass was beginning, heralded by the beginnings of the visibility of the red star. Today is the day that thread will fall. You and the rest of the people of your hold have been feeling uneasy for a few hours now. No signs of thread until...\n\nWhat's this? Are those the signal drums? In controlled panic tempered slightly by the knowledge of what to do, all have gathered together here inside the hold. Once everyone was confirmed present, the heavy metal doors were closed and barred. You now sit near a tiny window. You can no longer deny that thread still exists, and that it has come. The ominous pattering against the metal roof and doors... that must be thread that has managed to get through the formations of dragons and even some firelizards that you can hear zooming through the air as well. You and the other people here seem to be safe, though. Thread eats anything living, but it can't get through metal. All you can do for now is watch and hope and wait. No death or pain bellows of injured people or draconic creatures so far. The dragonriders in the skies above must have kept up their practice these long years since the last time this happened.\n\nhttps://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?title=Pern%3A%20Threadfall&amp;g1=polyrhythmBeatGenerator.php?l=69000000000000000000&amp;title=War%2520Drum&amp;&amp;g2=babbleNoiseGenerator.php?l=00000000003949390000&amp;title=&amp;&amp;g3=oblivionSoundscapeGenerator.php?l=00004300430000002613&amp;title=Amnesia&amp;&amp;g4=summerFestivalSoundscapeGenerator.php?l=00000000000000490000&amp;title=&amp;&amp;g5=tinRoofRainNoiseGenerator.php?l=34493429390000000000&amp;title=&amp;",

            "selftext": "Have you ever had a supergen and wanted to change the settings of one generator, or replace or remove one completely? If you have spent a lot of time on it, it'd be really tedious to do again. All the data is stored in the URL so in principle, there should be a way to do all of those things just by manipulating the URL. However, when you create a supergen, the URL gets converted to a different format and becomes riddled with percentage marks, which normal single noise generator URLS don't have. Sure, there is a computational logic to how to translate different encodings to others but since I'm no expert, I can't identify what kind of string converter I'm supposed to use in order to get it converted correctly, so here's the logic of how to do it by hand if all else fails.\n\nI had trouble with this myself so as I finally figured it out and wrote myself some documentation, I thought that I'd share, in case someone needs this.\n\n\n**TUTORIAL: EXTRACT SINGLE GENERATOR's STANDALONE URL FROM SUPERGENS**\n\nLet's assume that I have a supergen URL like this: https://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=remiDeckerDroneGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D0035000000000000002500%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;g2=meadowCreekSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D3522191820224025351711%26a%3D1%26am%3D1%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;g3=elGreyVocalSoundscape.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D3535353535000000000000%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;g4=&amp;g5=&amp;yt=\n\nAnd I want to extract the first generator, the Folk Tradition generator, to be a standalone that looks like this:\nhttps://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/remiDeckerDroneGenerator.php?l=0035000000000000002500&amp;m=&amp;d=0\n\nAnd also the Meadow Land generator that's in the middle of it to be like this:\nhttps://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/meadowCreekSoundscapeGenerator.php?l=3522191820224025351711&amp;a=1&amp;am=1&amp;m=&amp;d=0\n\n\n\nI highly recommend doing this in a computer's simple text editor such as Notepad or TextEdit, where you can easily manipulate the text and perform search-and-replace actions.\n\nLogically, in the supergen URL, &amp; means \"and\", and = means \"is\".\n\nAlso in the URL, g1 means generator 1, g2 generator 2, g3 generator 3 and so on.\n\nIf you look at the URL, you'll notice that (according to those special characters), the first generator is expressed as *g1=* which can be interpreted as \"generator one IS\".\n\nThe next generators are in the form *&amp;g2=* which would be interpreted as \"AND generator two IS\".\n\nThese are the important separators that tell you where one address ends and another begins.\n\nThe *beginning part* of every standalone generator URL that you will be reconstructing will start with https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/ and you will be pasting the reconstructed part of an URL to come after this part.\n\n\nNow look at the supergen URL and identify the first generator: It's the part of the URL that's between g1= and &amp;g2= because remember, that's the separator that means \"AND generator two is...\". \n\nSo highlight and copy that part of the supergen URL and paste it after the incomplete NoiseMachines URL shown above. Put this whole newly constructed URL into the computer's text editor, as you'll be doing search-and-replace actions: searching all instances of a certain string, and automatically replacing them with content that you define. You'll need to do three search-and-replace actions, in this order:\n\nReplace every instance of %3D with =\n\nReplace every instance of %26 with &amp;\n\nReplace every instance (there's just one) of %3Fc=3&amp; with ?\n\nNow that URL should look normal, and NOT contain any percentage marks. Test if it works.\n\nTo extract the second generator which is in the middle, from the supergen url you copy a part that's between &amp;g2= and &amp;g3= , if there is a third generator after that, that is. And do the same character replacements.\n\n\nIf you want to modify the extracted single gens in order to make a new supergen, edit the settings, then follow the supergen creation rules as usual: hit \"Save as URL\", then get that new URL which contains the new settings, and head to create the supergen.",

You're awesome, and your website is awesome, and it's something that completely changed the way I studied in school before I graduated, focused at work after, and played games all in between. It's one of those things I never even thought about before I found, but since then can not imagine how I'd get by without it, and just feels like it should have always existed. I recommend it to everyone every time I get the chance. I've indoctrinated countless study buddies. The main reason it's so impactful to me is that I don't listen to musical instruments for religious reasons, but noise is still a powerful tool and sound a powerful sense, but it's very difficult finding good quality sounds to listen to that don't have music in them. So your website is like a vegan five star buffet opening up in a world where meat was previously mixed in with any good food. I'm sure I'm not the kind of person you had in mind when you made this website, but it's absolutely perfect for me and people like me that also struggled studying or focusing.\n\n2. A request; I love your series of sounds from when you visited Morocco, they're some of my favorite, especially the nocturnal garden with the haunting azhan (prayer call). When I visited Morocco, I feel in love with their very beautiful and very unique azhan, and the apartment I stayed at was attached to a masjid, so every dawn prayer I was woken up by that almost sad calling filling my room. It gives me chills hearing it again. (*\"Oh my Lord, indeed we have heard a caller calling.\"*) I don't know if you'll make a similar trip any time soon, but if you do, a sound I have scoured the internet for for years and failed to find is an atmosphere of sitting inside a masjid. When I was in Fes, known as the City of Masjids for the shear number of masjids they have, as well as their beauty, I would try to enter every masjid I passed by and offer the prayer of entering a masjid. Then, if I had the time, I would sit for a while and listen. My favorites are the older, smaller masjids you find out of your way, away from any bustling markets or city centers. In some of these, no microphones would be used, and instead you would only hear the whispers of people offering their prayers, and the old Shiekh of the masjid might be sitting in front reciting supplications, or remembrance of the names of God, or praises and thanks. And maybe from outside the open door you'd hear the trickle of the fountains of ablution as people wash themselves for prayer, and the occasional dove or songbird, or the chatter of a distant market. In those moments I felt like I was transported through time. I'm sure you can't recreate exactly the memory I have in my mind, and that memory might not truly exist anywhere in the world, but I thought I might describe it to you so that you might be inspired. I often listen to the Gregorian chants and church noises you have on your website, which are very similar to the atmosphere I'd like, but it would be incredible to have a similar atmosphere made in a masjid. I've even tried finding audio of remembrances, tazkeer, being made to superimpose on your church sounds, but to my complete surprise, somehow no good recordings of such a thing exists as far as I can find, which is mind boggling to me, with how big a part of our faith it is, and how beautiful and spiritual it is.",

Those that tell him to rest, that his journey is impossible, telling him to stop, pleading for him to stop. Sometimes, he hears birds, and for a moment he thinks back to his younger days in the forests of home, before hearing the cawing of an infernal black bird, crows, watching and no doubt waiting for him to fall.\n\nAs he reaches the end of the forest, he sees it. The tall black mountain, an insurmountable challenge. Insurmountable...to most.\n\n\n\nWish me luck on my first SuperGenThe idea behind this is a walk though a hostile landscape, a challenge with an impossible goal, but his man (a character of mine) has to make his way to the top to return to the land of the living. This is something to get me in the mindset of writing for my characters and sometimes villains. Perhaps other writers and DMs could use this as an Infernal muse.\n\nhttps://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=autumnWalkSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D1%26l%3D00000078000000450000%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;g2=battlefieldRPGSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D1%26l%3D37005400380000000000%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;g3=elementsRPGSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D1%26l%3D99456203030000000000%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;g4=evilCharmRPGSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D1%26l%3D44624731000000323358%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;g5=oblivionSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D1%26l%3D77533900274400240061%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;yt=",

The background noise of the ship's engines, accompanied by the tireless hiss/rumble of the life support systems is audible but not overly intrusive. As you finish your preparations for sleep and slide under the covers, a light draws your attention to the small window. Oh. You smile, noting that it's a star glimmering tirelessly in the distance as the ship passes by. The star wasn't very near, or maybe the ship's filtering technology dampens incoming light so that the crew and passengers aren't adversely affected. You relax more, your breathing slows... Is that another star sliding into existence? Yes it is. That one passes, too, and the starship continues its flight. In a few moments, another star, this one a different, but equally soothing color, shines its welcoming, warm light seemingly just for you. You're close to drifting off now.

Approaching the portholes, you are struck speechless by the view. You can't miss the violently roiling clouds seeming to entirely shroud an unimaginably massive sphere. You know this must be a true force of cosmic fury. It's a gas giant! Intricate belts of startling color rage around the giant as storms ravage this unbridled ball of blinding belligerence.

Whilst technology has long since overtaken that crude approach, nonetheless I think his principles still hold\n\na) Non repetitive and practically endless and not starting from the same point at the beginning\n\nb) No human played instruments (eg hitting an object with a mallet can be achieved by water or wind power - like temple chimes)\n\nc) as far as possible fx on a sound should be achieved naturally   eg vibrato by interference sine waves or by a paddle wheel (like the vox humana stop on a reed organ)\n\nd) no discernible melody in the musical sense\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found it so counter-productive to have your mind unconsciously recognising repetition or a melodic pattern.  One is trying to zone out so the soundscape fades into the background and never distracts the flow. So clearly no sudden volume changes or violent percussion.  It should flow gently like a stream (rill)\n\nUp to you\n\nPersonally I dont like white noise in the bg.  Its a bit like having a fan on in the room - its annoying.  So for me, bird song, dawn chorus with the recorded white noise bg feels wrong cos if you hear it naturally, you are not aware of any bg (unless a strong wind is blowing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust my 2c because I was surprised at the amount of noise-scapes that contained instrumentals.  There are thousands of repetitive ambient sites out there that I found deeply annoying\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope maybe there are other like minded souls out there who see my point of view. otherwise - what ever floats your boat\n\nRobin",

This makes me curious more than anything.\n2. The way sound is stopped is kinda weird. You can close out the app or take out earbuds and it won't stop the sound. You have to manually pause. This is slightly annoying when in the morning I take out my earbuds and I hear a wonderfully synthesized bog soundscape at full volume, then try to close the app only to have to then reopen it and pause. I'm not 100 on whether thats a bug or a feature.\nOther than that, boys you did it. shit is crafted. I love this app so damn much. i spend hella time just scrolling thru all the options you have. I have been looking forward to the piano synth (88 keys was the name i think?) hella much.

Now I'm using it as inspiration and as a noise blocker (my computer is in the lounge room due to space restrictions and my headphones, while made to block sound, aren't super effective at it thanks to my glasses breaking their sound seal slightly).\n\nIt uses **Traffic Noise**, **White Rain**, **Oblivion**, **Babble Noise** and **Poltergeist** to create an ambience of a rainy street at night with background traffic and voices, with random industrial sounds and a creepy undertone.  I've found it very effective at blocking voices and other nearby sounds, which is pleasing to me but less so to my cat, who is forced to tap my knee with her paw to get my attention.

I spent a good 3 hours working on this SG ~~(hooray insomnia!)~~. I wanted something to accompany my \"ancient Egyptian\" writing muse. I will be making another soon, with the Duduk tones. For now, this one eases me into a sense of being alone in a tent just on the edge of the desert, the evening winds tossing sand at the sides of my shelter. The sandstorm rolling over the dunes in the distance isn't a threat - yet. If I get really into the ancient Egypt muse for this, I might try my hand at making a couple reminisce of Nile fishing villages or temple settings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis might also work well if \"Unreal Wind\" is replaced with some of the other wind-scapes, I Just settled on Unreal Wind as - to me - it meshes well with the sounds of Desert Wind to provide the setting I wanted. This would also work well if combined with a crackling fire (gotta keep warm during the desert night!), and/or with the addition of the sounds of sleeping people from the Berber Tent sliders if you would rather be part of a merchant caravan or a guard patrol. Also, Saharan Caravan would be a good replacement for Nocturnal Garden if you wish for the \"traveling caravan\" aspect instead of the \"settling down for the night\" as it has the pack animal movement sounds - I might play with that in the morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been using myNoise to write, to distract from my own thoughts, and to help me sleep since some time in 2014 - and I have to say, I love the Super Gens. I had a slew of custom-tailored slider settings for a lot of the original generators many moons ago, but sadly I've lost most of them. I'll be going through over the next few days and taking a stab at recreating some of my old favorites, and will probably post some of them here to keep track of them.",

I use its sounds in almost all my meditative mixes and some of my sleep ones. Unfortunately, I have noticed a strange skipping sound like all the strands are restarting, sometimes all at once, or sometimes intermixed and I have narrowed it down to the sounds that come from Chapel Voices. I've included a link to chapel voices with the sounds that are causing the most issues for me highlighted. Could you have a listen and tell me if you are also experiencing something weird. Alternatively, if it sounds exactly as you think it should, let me know. I emailed St\u00e9phane this morning and he got back to me promptly to let me know that for him Chapel Voices was preforming as expected and suggested that it was an issue with my phone. I'd agree, except that I get the problem on my laptop as well! Tell me if I am hearing things!\n\n[Chapel voices with the noises that are giving me the most trouble highlighted](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/chapelVoicesSoundscape.php?l=08064952505656080806&amp;m=&amp;d=0)",
