You can star your favorite noises from the main page already to recall what you loved the most, so might a \"favorite supergens\" be an additional patron-only box for those hotlinks? And unstar to remove supergen from favorites, for example. Subjective user favorites, just like the single generator stars are now.

The spreadsheet can be found on Google Docs at [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLrAP7usd0O9lsXnPzuc2JhOMiITU2YF64qcHTkCMWw/edit?usp=sharing). All you have to do is select between one and five sounds from the dropdowns, and a list of all the supergens that use the selected sounds will appear in the results section. Because I don't want there to be problems with multiple people trying to use the filters at the same time, I made it read-only, so **please make a personal copy to use the search function.**\n\nUnfortunately, it is not completely up to date. I added everything that is currently on the supergen master list and started adding a few that have been posted since the last time the master list was updated. But that is a bit of a slog, so I figured in the meantime, I would post it here in case anyone wants to try it out.\n\nAlso, if you notice any typos or inconsistencies in the sound names, please let me know so I can fix it. The search function won't recognize the sound name if it doesn't match the name in the dropdown list.\n\nAny and all feedback is welcome.\n\n**Edit: LOL jk it is up to date.

You approach on an ancient, beaten path as one of the few throughout millennia to take refuge in its severe yet strangely comforting halls. \n\nAs you look out and see the empty valleys and peaks, obscured by unrelenting wind and snow, you feel grateful for the shelter of the towering walls of stone, defiant and unbending towards the elements, as it has been throughout the ages. \n\nAs you unpack what little you brought with you, you set up near a fire pit and begin your important work.

It has recently come to our attention that his account has been banned by reddit in a nefarious way, [the shadowban](https://enhanceviewsbugs.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/340520-what-is-reddit-shadowban). When an account is shadowbanned, reddit makes it appear to the user of the account that everything is normal, that all their posts and comments are appearing. However, to everyone else, those posts and comments never appear. The shadowban on St\u00e9phane's account happened about a year ago, and we have been living in ignorance of it since. We don't have any idea how this may have happened, but he is currently talking to the reddit admins about why the ban occurred, and the possibility of having it reversed. We wanted to apologize sincerely for this drop in engagement, and for not having noticed sooner. I am also to blame, as we live in opposing timezones, I've always assumed that I am seeing posts before he is, and thinking to myself \"Oh, this is a question best suited for the man himself, /u/audiosampling will reply when he sees it\" and not knowing that he has, in fact, already replied, just that no one other than he can see it. Thank you for your understanding of this issue, we are actively working to get things back to normal again.\n\nMatt\n\nP.S.\nHere are some examples of posts that were never shown to the community:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/6mRME  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MyNoise/comments/6gmskw/question_about_mynoise_generators_who_have_this/?sort=new\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/QlREp  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MyNoise/comments/54vkq9/careful_now_re_donations/d85ufj8/",

What's relevant to know is that I use the binaural beats generator in combination with Spotify, but even without Spotify on it kills itself after a while. \n\nI tried searching this subreddit but came up short.
