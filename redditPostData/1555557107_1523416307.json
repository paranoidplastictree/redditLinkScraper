She has a sirenic ability to lull men with a song or a whisper. When she gains the power to manifest as a hologram, Sharon pays Isamu an unwanted visit in the cockpit of his space fighter jet, determined to mesmerize him and assume control. Now he sleeps ... but what does he hear in his slumber?  \n\n\nI've tried to balance aircraft tower sounds with eerie melodic tones reminiscent of the ethereal music of the original scene.  Sharon is represented by the woman's whisper from \"Healing Trees\".  \n\n\nThe scene itself is available on YouTube if you search for [\"Macross Plus\" \"Isamu Falls\"](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=\"macross+plus\"+\"isamu+falls\"). It probably counts as NSFW because Sharon's hologram appears \"nude\" (not explicit, but rather like a mannequin). There are two versions of the scene. The movie version is longer than the mini-series version, but either will do.  \n\n\nFeedback appreciated!",

I'm David and I'm a university freshman.\n\nAs someone with potentially undiagnosed ADHD, this website is a godsend, and /u/audiosampling (creator of myNoise) is a god amongst men.\n\nTypically, I can't ever focus on studying or doing homework without procrastinating pretty quickly. Even if it's urgent, I can't ever seem to 100% sit down and focus on my work. However, the night before my first final (which I had yesterday), I discovered this website. It is what I was looking for all these years.\n\nIn the past, I would either listen to stuff like [epic music mixes](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=epic+music+mix), [this piano livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMHGjoxJdQ), [this cafe music livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ccaHpy5Ewo), or [this lofi hip-hop stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsBrT6vbQa8). However, what I quickly noticed was that I could pick out when tracks repeated or looped back around, and this within itself got distracting. Now, with myNoise, I can just turn on a couple of ambient noise generators, sit back, and listen/study/focus/meditate.\n\nThis is seriously the greatest thing ever. I've seen PLENTY of noise generator websites and apps before, and this takes the cake with it's multiple settings, seemingly endless sound list, and simplistic but functional UI. I've only used 2 so far (piano and thunder), but I'm already thoroughly impressed.\n\nSt\u00e9phane --\n\nThank you. Thank you so much. This is perhaps the best thing to happen to me all semester, and I consider it to be an early Christmas present. I can already tell that I'll be using this website for a long time to come, and as an aspiring musician/pianist/singer, your website may help me conjure up some ideas for songs. I'm usually at my most creative when listening to music or sounds, so this website serves me in more ways than one. I sincerely hope you get the financial stability you seek, and that you'll have many more donations coming your way.\n\n[Here's his donation page.](https://mynoise.net/donate.php) When donating, not only do you get to support this website and help keep it up for a long time to come, but you also get plenty of features exclusive to donors such as: \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/lv6LCm6.png\n\nOnce again, thank you! &lt;3\n\n~ David",

I was in a transitional state in my life, and found a fleeting moment that brought me calm exactly when I needed it - near a small boardwalk restaurant, a jam band setting up, the ocean in the distance. Now, in a cubicle farm in New York City, I found a generator to bring back that state of mind. \n\nThis uses African Trance, Unreal Ocean, Babble Noise, and Telecaster Licks.

At any point in the process, press \\[x+c\\] to clear the hidden stack.

You walk blindly, navigating by the rustles, hisses and squeals of the nocturnal beasts all around you. The forest floor is teeming with life that you can't see. An ominous wind rustles the leaves somewhere above and the air smells different: the weather is changing. Thunder rumbles in the distance and there's a constant threat of possible rain. It might only be a matter of time, but you're already walking as fast as is possible in a dark forest. Occasionally a lightning in the sky briefly illuminates the entire forest, flashing you a picture of the tree silhouettes all around you. Hopefully you can stay on the right course to get into safety.",

This soundscape immediately reminded me of a specific character, which for us culturally is probably the first thing that we associate with the vagabond mindset that this soundscape is.\n\nA best friend to the main character, Snufkin is an introverted vagabond who keeps to himself and lives in a tent by the river. He'd spend all summer with his friends in the valley, but every autumn, he'd pack his things and head into the mountains on foot. \nThis soundscape brings about the autumn scenes: The colors in the cool early dawn are minimal, there's mist, and Snufkin always leaves early before anyone would notice, to avoid having to deal with his best friend's sadness over the parting. He'd walk up the misty mountain path with a heavy load on his back, never revealing where he goes every winter and what happens on his journeys. He loves the friends in the valley, but he also needs his solitude, and that's all. He would eventually return with his distinguished harmonica tune as inevitably as the spring, with wisdom to share.\n\n[Gif from series](https://img.aijaa.com/b/00556/14630714.gif)\n\n[Snippet from original book](https://img.aijaa.com/b/00379/14630715.jpg)",

You hear the various creatures of the night: night birds, cicadas, crickets. And pass porticoes out which you glimpse the shadowy silhouettes of cypresses, juniper cedars, and olive trees. The houses away in the village below the palace proper begin to lose their light as servants douse the lamps for the night. Your one torch lights your way through the open-roofed Central Court, down a set of stairs and around a corner before you reach the Shrine. Small candles and objects meant as gifts for the gods surround a horned plinth in between two labrys axes. You sit before it, poor a rhyton of diluted wine into a cup and offer it up to the gods, in hopes that the boar hunt the next day will yield wondrous feast. For now though, you begin to travel back to the North Insula to sleep, for surely the sacred bull slain earlier in the day and your own prayers will ensure the happiness of the King and all who live at Knossos.\n\n\nhttps://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=palmGardenAtNightSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D0033333333333333333300%26d%3D0&amp;g2=dudukSoundGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D0000585877770000000000%26d%3D0&amp;g3=stalactitesCaveChimeSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D4444440000000044444400%26d%3D0&amp;g4=dungeonRPGSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D0000000000996800002500%26d%3D0&amp;g5=fireNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D0089006300004500000000%26d%3D0&amp;yt=",

Your crew is unnerved by the distant sound of cannon shots. Must stay ahead of them. The engine room pounds out power to go faster, higher, longer than any other airship. Steam flaps through the sails, the clocks showing the times in London, New York, and Hong Kong all tick and chime at different rates, different moments. You look at your pocket watch; half past noon. Your quartermaster on deck hails you and hands you a spyglass. A black airship emerging from the fog just a few miles of the stern seems to be spewing fire from its figurehead. The quartermaster just asked you something.\n\"Captain?\"\nYou nod to him in acknowledgement.\n\"What do you propose we do?\"\nA decision must be made. Do you stand and fight? Or flee through the cover of clouds to camouflage your vessel? You are indeed the captain of this airship; your decision will decide its fate and that of its crew. So, Captain, what do you do?",

Everything was normal, except when I went to the downloads, it said everything was free, and anything that wasn't free said \"coming soon\".

I am a big Sonic the Hedgehog fan and while the game that came out in 2006 was met with seething hatred I actually enjoyed its plot. I tend to write a lot of fanfics in my spare time and many of them center around this era in the STH fandom.\n\nFor those who don't know, the sonic game that came out in '06 centered around a girl who happened to be the princess of Soleanna. The game both starts and ends with a festival celebrating the country's patron deity, Solaris. This event, known as the [Festival of the Sun](https://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=loonLakeCanoeSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D3340000000000001003700%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;g2=fireworksNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D6099606099606060606000%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;g3=orchestronDroneGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D5143290030003000313000%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;g4=battlefieldRPGSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D9900000000000000000000%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;g5=&amp;yt=s1V3XOrXtuo), featured fireworks and gondolas -as Soleanna was based off of Paris.\n\nNotes: I'm sorry it has taken me so long to post another multigen. I had switched jobs and had little time for anything else. BE WARNED: the volume has been adjusted for SPEAKERS not headphones so it may be loud when first loaded up. Also, the youtube link with crowd noise may not have its volume adjusted so be wary as this is naturally loud. As well, though the video is an hour in length, if you are planned to listen for more than an hour be sure to right click on the embedded video and select loop. It's not an exact loop but the author made is so that towards the end it will fade seamlessly towards the start so you may have a brief second or two of intermission.\n\nOne last thing: If anyone knows if there is a generator that naturally has cheering in it let me know, as I couldn't find one and just thought it easier to locate a vid on youtube. Personally, I'm not really that happy with the Fireworks generator on MyNoise. I feel like it's one of the ones that needs an update. Most of the sliders just feature crackling, which is already accomplished on other generators like Fireplace. It's missing some really good ones like poppers, sparklers, screamers, and just deep, random, booming in the distance. That's the only reason RPG Battlefield was added, for moon oomph.",
