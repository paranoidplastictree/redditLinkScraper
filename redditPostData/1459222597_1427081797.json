So, being the lazy person that I am, I simply copied from the generator title, for example from:\n\"http://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/infiniteChoirDroneGenerator.php\" I copied \"infiniteChoirDroneGenerator.php\", then in my existing super generator, added it between the lines \"g1=\" and \"%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D\" like this:\n\"g1=infiniteChoirDroneGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D\", where the g1 stands for the first generator in the super generator.  All you have to do then is adjust your sliders the way you'd like them and click on \"Update SuperGen Link\".  Bookmark and voila!  You have an updated supergen.  The same idea can be used to add or remove individual generators too.\n\nSorry if this is common knowledge, but I could not find it using the search function on this subreddit.

And I still love me the spooky supergens.\n\nThe latter two have Youtube videos attached; they shouldn't blow your ears out or anything, but you might want to put them at half-volume or so.\n\n---\n\n[Coming to Town](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=telecasterLicksMusicGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D25410000544700002300&amp;g2=oceanNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00003932303100000000&amp;g3=dustyScratchedVinylNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D36392826200818000000&amp;g4=&amp;g5=&amp;yt=)\n\nThe town of Silent Hill has been called a \"ghost town\" at times. Once a thriving spot of tourism, it now languishes from a poor reputation and even poorer weather - but you find yourself at its borders today. You park your car outside of town, on a small cliff bordering the wide shores of Toluca Lake. Fog has rolled in; there isn't much of a view. Still, you can hear water lapping on the shore below, almost peacefully. You can feel that this place has a long history.\n\n[Through the Fog](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=audioJammerNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D28060911000000000418%26a%3D4&amp;g2=inUteroSoundGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D56343700484000000000&amp;g3=evilCharmRPGSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000000375543000000&amp;g4=enchantedForestSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00003800003600390000&amp;g5=dungeonRPGSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000036300047000036&amp;yt=Bt7KeshGMpI)\n\nThere's something wrong in this town. You're hearing sounds, seeing things, and can feel the hair on the back of your neck stand on end. Some... thing attacked you a minute ago; you can still feel its claws where they tore at your arm. You managed to fight it off, but it's still out there somewhere, lurking beyond the range of your vision. You can still hear it crying out.\n\nThere's a radio sitting on a bench nearby. It's turned on, spewing static into the air, and as the THING comes closer, the sound of the radio becomes louder. It might come in handy to keep with you.\n\n*(But when they come too close, and the noise becomes too much, maybe you should turn it off. Better not to attract their attention.)*\n\n[Otherworld](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=demolitionWorkNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000031563217000000&amp;g2=fanNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D20181354810016000000%26a%3D2&amp;g3=prehistoricCavemenMusicGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000000005029000000&amp;g4=dungeonRPGSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D49604823400000423351&amp;g5=&amp;yt=_6F0pcSSqSo)\n\nThe world twisted around you as the sirens called. The streets fell away, leaving behind sheets of rusted metal and chain-link fences. Your head is pounding with the groans and shrieks of old machinery grinding against itself. It's so dark now... there isn't fog anymore, but the sky is black and you can't see except by your old, flickering flashlight.\n\nThis place, this... world... is dangerous. Terror penetrates you to the bone. It's not safe to use your radio here; if you do, whatever lurks around the dark corners of this warped town might find you.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you have suggestions for changes, or if you have a favorite!",

In this sound-scape I have combined a few very selective sounds from three MyNoise generators into what early Homo sapiens living there might have experienced in lieu of a Thursday night sit-com. From Canyon Drone comes the native flute (albeit of North America, but hey ... a paleolithic technology, so, close enough?); from Cave Chime come the sounds of stalactites being gently hammered as vibrating bells; and from Prehistory come the sounds of bull-roarers, and the blowing of conch shells and mammoth tusks as horns. (Prehistory also has the sound of a stalactite, which it calls a \"lithophone\", but I chose to use the sliders from Cave Chime only.) \n\nNote, if you click to the meditation room you'll lose the highly selective nature of this sound-scape when other sounds eventually get included. But that's OK, as long as you're enjoying it! \n\nI also intend to use the more complex super-generator at MyNoise to create a moving sequence, in order to add a few rotating poly-rhythms from African Trance. Then we won't just have a Thursday sit-com, we'll have Cro Magnon prime time! \n\n[Ard\u00e8che Grotto](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=canyonDroneGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000000190000000000&amp;g2=stalactitesCaveChimeSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00002000000020002500&amp;g3=prehistoricCavemenMusicGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00210000000013001600&amp;g4=&amp;g5=&amp;yt=)\n\nHope this thing works.

Each supergen should be able to audibly transport you to the right location, hopefully in such a way where you might be able to guess where you were, even without reading the description. I've put more notes below. Enjoy!*\n\n[**Hogwarts Express**](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=whiteRainNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D50464238343027242118&amp;g2=babbleNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D35363633221100000000&amp;g3=windNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D16271524272213050000&amp;g4=railroadNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D51433233342734343223&amp;g5=thunderNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D40404040404000000000&amp;yt=)\n\n&gt;A gloomy day, not an overly cheery start for the school year. Still, the distant thunder rumbling, the sound of the heavy train following the tracks it's trundled across countless times before, the sound of other students talking excitedly through the walls. At least for now, things do seem peaceful.\n\n* *All of the sounds on board the Hogwarts Express have been brown-shifted to some degree to give you feeling of the deep rumbling of the train on the tracks. The white rain and thunder tracks are both included, although the thunder track has had its rain portions silenced in order to allow for more control.*\n\n[**The Great Hall**](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=churchAtmosphereSoundGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000000493400262800&amp;g2=babbleNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D27333646515750423021&amp;g3=cafeRestaurantNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D51415044393022454330&amp;g4=babbleNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D52525043363134424647&amp;g5=thunderNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D44444444444400000000&amp;yt=)\n\n&gt;Yes, welcome to the Great Hall. Most school meetings, as well as some very important exams, will take place in this room. There are many other rules that we shall go over later, but now that all the first years are sorted, let us begin the feast!\n\n* *The Great Hall should be easy to pick out on sound alone, as the chorus of voices and eating should drown out most other sounds, aside from the loud, echoing footsteps in the hall, and the distant rumble of the ceiling attempting to mimic the gloom outside.*\n\n[**Gryffindor Common Room**](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=fireNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D44404347410022140600&amp;g2=babbleNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D33443334282428232018&amp;g3=palmGardenSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D05050505050523052305&amp;g4=windNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D55332822222220182239&amp;g5=airportTerminalNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D05050505050505280548&amp;yt=)\n\n&gt; So, you're a Gryffindor! Step right up, alright the password for now is \"dragon pox.\" Yes the Fat Lady will swing aside, in you go, in you go. Ah, I see some of the older students are already here, and they've opened a window. Wonderful. Feel free to relax by the fire, and once term has started, to study here if need be, although this will still be an area to socialize with your fellow Gryffindors. Have a good year!\n\n* *While each common room has some of the same sounds (each has a fireplace, and the sounds of students babbling, for instance), I wanted to make sure to include something unique to each common room, so that listening to them was still a different experience. So for example, even if you're a Ravenclaw, you might enjoy the sounds of the birds calling from the open windows outside of the Gryffindor tower, and the subtle, gray-shifted wind rustling through the room.*\n\n[**Hufflepuff Common Room**](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=fireNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D75675664260018402141&amp;g2=catPurrNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D45423835312217141108&amp;g3=airportTerminalNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D05050505050505280558&amp;g4=cafeRestaurantNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D30213930190031221609&amp;g5=babbleNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D26354125364449422917&amp;yt=)\n\n&gt;A Hufflepuff! I might've known. Don't listen to the lot who might put you down, Hufflepuff is just as proud and noble a house as any other. This way, this way, our common room is here near the kitchens. Don't mind the sound of utensils clattering every once in a while, that's just the house elves doing their work. As this is the common room, feel free to meet fellow Hufflepuffs here, as well as do any schoolwork you need doing. Oh and don't mind Persephone. Unlike the animals you may have purchased before coming to school, Persephone lives here. She especially loves to curl up with Hufflepuffs enjoying the fire.\n\n* *The overall goal was to make Hufflepuff feel cozy, warm, and inviting. The babble has been appropriately shifted to sound more boisterous, and the purring was added to add more of that toasty, at-home feel. The clinks of the cafe were added as the Hufflepuff room is near the kitchens, and there are three vocal tracks, as Hufflepuffs are social beings. Also, my wife linked me [this](http://www.tor.com/2013/07/16/everyone-should-want-to-be-a-hufflepuff-or-stop-the-hogwarts-house-hate/) recently, I thought I'd pass it along for all the Hufflepuff haters out there.*\n\n[**Ravenclaw Common Room**](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=clockTickTockNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D30000000003010002804&amp;g2=fireNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D49404553450030242117&amp;g3=thunderNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D56545554502932353539&amp;g4=airportTerminalNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000000000000280051&amp;g5=babbleNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000006081108272931&amp;yt=)\n\n&gt;\"What can one put into a barrel to make it lighter?\"  \n\"...a hole.\"  \n\"Well said.\"  \nYes yes, step inside Ravenclaws. Keep in mind that the riddle is always different, and you won't be granted access without an acceptable answer, so you'll need to keep your mind sharp. This is the Ravenclaw common room, here you are free to pursue your academic as well as social aspirations. Feel free to sit near the fire and work on your studies, or even beneath the window. Don't mind it being open, there's an enchantment that keeps the rain from getting in. And please remember that, even though this is the common room, others may be trying to study, so we request that you attempt to keep your voices down while others are working. Right, off you go!\n\n* *For Ravenclaw, I thought the addition of the clock was more than appropriate, as Ravenclaws may need the reminder of the time, lest they get lost in their thoughts. I've also white-shifted the babbling so that the human sounds here are more whispers than what you would find in Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, Ravenclaws would want to have respect for others who are attempting to think. Also, a big thanks to /u/SunSoakedBat, [from which I got the riddle](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/1y5hko/ravenclaw_riddles/).*\n\n[**Slytherin Common Room**](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=fireNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D11253032344940491157&amp;g2=airportTerminalNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D05050505050505280540&amp;g3=dungeonRPGSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D03243527120646221400&amp;g4=babbleNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D30403034424435182621&amp;g5=churchAtmosphereSoundGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000000453300232300&amp;yt=)\n\n&gt;Slytherins, step this way, come on all of you. Yes, you've all got a fine look about you, you'll make excellent Slytherins. Watch your step, our common room is here in the dungeons. This will be your common area for the remainder of the school year. This is where trust is formed. Alliances are forged. Your fellow Slytherins will know you better than anyone by the time the school year is out. Use this area to form those bonds. Have a great year.\n\n* *I wanted the Slytherin common room to feel both like the dungeon that it is, as well as a normal common room at the same time. It's still a room for schoolchildren to hang out in, so it couldn't just be dank and disgusting to listen to. There still needed to be a bit of warmth (the fireplace) and normal chatter. Still, the echoing footsteps and subtle sound of chains on the walls, as well as the white-shifted fire noise help to make the ambiance a bit less cozy and inviting than common rooms like Gryffindor and Hufflepuff.*\n\n[**The Quidditch Pitch**](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=palmGardenSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D16000000000025252525&amp;g2=windNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00172200002000223235&amp;g3=winterSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000000253000000000&amp;g4=grasslandSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000000000000301557&amp;g5=howlingParaglideSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D07123032340913046907&amp;yt=)\n\n&gt;So, you've an interest in Quidditch? Well this is the right place. The Gryffindor team is practicing now, you can see them rushing around. If you're the right sort, you'll get on your house's team soon enough. For now, you're welcome to watch and get acquainted with the game. Or maybe you already know the game? Maybe you've already got your position picked out? Or maybe you don't even care, you just like to sit in the stands because it's nice up here, away from the others.\n\n* *I wanted the Quidditch pitch to evoke sitting up in the tall stands. The many sounds of birds and insects are present as they would be a fair way away from the school. There's also the wind and the sound of the paraglider, to evoke the feeling of being up high, and broomsticks zooming around the sky in front of you.*\n\n[**The Great Lake**](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=windSeaRainNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D07000000530026312200&amp;g2=infiniteChoirDroneGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D16160000000000131414%26a%3D1&amp;g3=windNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00101300001200131820&amp;g4=grasslandSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000000000000352430&amp;g5=palmGardenSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D05050505050522262425&amp;yt=)\n\n&gt;This is the Great Lake, you're more than welcome to lounge about its shore or even go for a swim if you'd like (it's deathly cold though!). Keep an eye out for the giant squid, although he is usually friendly. And if you keep your wits about you, you might even hear the song of the mermaids that live below the surface...\n\n* *The Great Lake wouldn't be complete without the mermaids, but I didn't want it to be constantly present, so the Aeternitas gen is animated so that they will fade in and out as time passes.*\n\n[**The Forbidden Forest**](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=evilCharmRPGSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D22212224000000232021%26a%3D1&amp;g2=didgeridooDroneGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00173119001911001913&amp;g3=windNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D37353229252321181514&amp;g4=jungleNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000000172709152129&amp;g5=ultrasonicNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D25201723290765096910&amp;yt=) [Eerie]\n\n&gt;Och, they've sent you into the Forbidden Forest? I wonder what you did... eh, it doesn't matter. Don't worry yourself too much, no student's actually died in here in years. It's really quite peaceful, the animals calling in the night. Although the last student that went in there said that they heard whispers in the trees. But that can't be true... can it?\n\n* *I did put an [eerie] tag on this one, as I wanted the forest to still sound like a normal forest, but to have an air of menacing dread that you would expect the Forbidden Forest to have. The whispers and monster noises of Evil Charm are animated to fade in and out, and the low drone of the Didgeridoo helps with this as well.*\n\n[**Hogsmeade**](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=winterSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D29234137261900000000&amp;g2=babbleNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D33333325160800000000&amp;g3=babbleNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000000303635353536&amp;g4=iceDroneGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00002200170017001721&amp;g5=airportTerminalNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000000350000363200&amp;yt=)\n\n&gt;Ah, welcome to Hogsmeade! Is this your first visit? The snow is bloody thick, but that's what all the pubs are for, right? Head inside and get yourself a butterbeer, once you're done puttering around in the ice.\n\n* *The last location I've done, for now. The Winter Walk gen was invaluable for the \"walking in snow\" sound, and the Ice World gen is there to just give everything a crisp, winter wonderland feel.*\n\nThese are my Harry Potter supergens thus far, but are there any other locations you think should be made? I've wracked my brain and I've got a couple of ideas, but if anyone has any requests, let me know and I'll make as many locations as people are interested in. I've been using these to help me focus for a while now, and as a huge Harry Potter nerd, I love the imagery in my mind of being at Hogwarts and working around its enchanted grounds.",

How many times have you done this now, just standing and gazing at those bookshelves? No, they haven't been moved, or so it appears. The door is still behind them though and on the other side of its old wooden frame is the room. Only once did you open it, the dog running in terror from the unseen. What was that sound? Breathe....CLANG! a paint can flies from the shelf barley missing your head it crashes onto the cinder-block wall behind you. The paint is red, no doubt used to cover the walls in the tiny room behind the shelf. Paralyzed in fear you feel the air pressure change as the shelf starts to violently shake. You can't move! The door is trying to open and as the gap widens between it and the shelves the voices come. they come as whispers at first and grow ever louder as if cacophonies of spirits surround you. \"WHAT DO YOU WANT!\" you shout at the heavy damp basement air. Silence...the whispers stop. The rumbling of the shelf stops. Silence.  You take a breath and realize you are now free. Quickly you step backwards turning to run up the stairs.  \"YYOOOOUUUUUU!\" the hollow voices cry in a deafening rasp as you hit the dirty floor. Your feet pulled out from under you by unseen hands. Weightless your body flies backwards towards the now fully open door. There is no escape.

It will be updated as new sounds are posted.\n\nHere's what to know:\n\n- Supergens are divided into three categories: Calm, Creepy, and Other. Calm and Creepy are fairly self-explanatory, whereas Other will include soundscapes that don't quite fit either category. These may be atmospheric sounds, meant to imitate a particular location or event, or tracks meant to help with concentration or pure noise blocking.\n- Each category is sorted alphabetically by the names given to each supergen.\n- Below each supergen is a preview list of the individual generators used in the mix. This is helpful if you're looking for creative uses of a particular sound, or if you're looking for a supergen you heard previously and can only remember a few of the sounds in it. These lists are sorted in alphabetical order (with the names seen on the \"Online Noises\" page).\n- After each supergen is the word (Link).

A 4- or 5-noise page like [this](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=polyrhythmBeatGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00555655000000000000&amp;g2=infiniteChoirDroneGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D98005100000000000000%26a%3D4&amp;g3=jungleNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00370038533961200000&amp;g4=singingBowlsDroneGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000000003751003138&amp;g5=throatSingingDroneGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000050390000000000&amp;yt=), on the other hand, nearly crashes just trying to load, and even after loading freezes every 5 seconds or so while my CPU usage dials up to 95% or more. I haven't had this problem with any other website, and it happens on any computer I use.\n\nHas anyone else been experiencing this problem?

I tend to use the animate feature on several generators, but this limits my possibilities to limit a sound level on a specific generator. Since the animate feature turns volume op and down for the different sliders it would be very nice to have a \"roof\" on one generator where when the animate feature is enabled it cannot pass this level. Maybe this has already been asked for before, and in that case im just voting this feature request op :-)",

Above the surface, you meet everything from parrots to caiman. In the cloudy waters of the river, you face off with packs of piranha and swim together with curious manatees. Upriver you can hear the roar of a sacred waterfall said to hide a secret. And of course, there are rumors of a shadowed figure that lurks in the mangroves on rainy nights...\n\n[Among the Mangroves](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=jungleNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00263148003444330000&amp;g2=waterStreamNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D66483628201720282211&amp;g3=froggyPondSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D52275600000000000000&amp;g4=&amp;g5=&amp;yt=_L7MI7TSYhs)\n\nThe icy sea chills you to the bone, but at least you can't feel the shrieking winds above. The grey skies let very little light down deep, and below you is an endless stretch of black. As you swim among the massive glaciers, you hear the groans and creaks of scraping ice. Seals, whales, and other large ocean fauna circle about you, curious about their new visitor - but you aren't adapted to the cold like they are.

This far down, there is no natural light and no current pushing you about. The water is eerily still, cold, and very quiet. The creatures down here often defy description, moving slowly and silently through the depths. At first, all you hear is your own breath and heartbeat and the slow tread of your fins. But there are other sounds, deep and long... are they echos of diving whales hunting large squid in the gorge? Are they caused by the billowing flow of geothermal vents? Or is there something more ancient and unknown calling out?\n\n[Into the Deep](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=deepOceanSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D17000000004800000000&amp;g2=inUteroSoundGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D12410000450000000000&amp;g3=evilCharmRPGSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000051000000000000&amp;g4=&amp;g5=&amp;yt=_i3thiCdul0)\n\nAfter a dive, it's time to warm up and dry off. This small island is a prime location for watching the stars and dozing off to the sounds of the waves lapping the shore. As you settle by the fire, your partner moves along the docks to break down the equipment and tie off the boat. The sun is sinking beneath the horizon, and the gulls are settling down for the night.\n\n[Sleepy Cove](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=ultrasonicNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D25390000000000000000&amp;g2=fireNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D27313834500030504254&amp;g3=oceanNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000022442246414621&amp;g4=ferryboatSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000039240000003436&amp;g5=healingWaterSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D57000000000000000000&amp;yt=9WKD0-iF38s)\n\n--------------------\n\nMost of these soundscapes share quite a few layers, but I hope you can feel the difference when you visualize them!\n\nLet me know which was your favorite place to 'dive'!",

And of course, there are rumors of a shadowed figure \n\nthat lurks in the mangroves on rainy nights...\n\n[The Frozen Sea](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?\n\ng1=finWhaleUnderwaterSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l\n\n%3D60563847455733251913&amp;g2=squeakingSailboatSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc\n\n%3D3%26l%3D93000000000000000000%26a\n\n%3D2&amp;g3=deepOceanSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l\n\n%3D29533926004436290000&amp;g4=windNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l\n\n%3D00000000162336000000&amp;g5=oceanNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l\n\n%3D32383446404637000000&amp;yt=jkX5rbxV4kI)\n\nThe icy sea chills you to the bone, but at least you can't feel the \n\nshrieking winds above. The grey skies let very little light down deep, and \n\nbelow you is an endless stretch of black. As you swim among the massive \n\nglaciers, you hear the groans and creaks of scraping ice. Seals, whales, \n\nand other large ocean fauna circle about you, curious about their new \n\nvisitor - but you aren't adapted to the cold like they are.

The creatures down here \n\noften defy description, moving slowly and silently through the depths. At \n\nfirst, all you hear is your own breath and heartbeat and the slow tread of \n\nyour fins. But there are other sounds, deep and long... are they echos of \n\ndiving whales hunting large squid in the gorge? Are they caused by the \n\nbillowing flow of geothermal vents? Or is there something more ancient and \n\nunknown calling out?\n\n[Sleepy Cove](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?\n\ng1=ultrasonicNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l\n\n%3D25390000000000000000&amp;g2=fireNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l\n\n%3D27313834500030504254&amp;g3=oceanNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l\n\n%3D00000022442246414621&amp;g4=ferryboatSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l\n\n%3D00000039240000003436&amp;g5=healingWaterSoundscapeGenerator.php%3Fc\n\n%3D3%26l%3D57000000000000000000&amp;yt=9WKD0-iF38s)\n\nAfter a dive, it's time to warm up and dry off. This small island is a \n\nprime location for watching the stars and dozing off to the sounds of the \n\nwaves lapping the shore. As you settle by the fire, your partner moves \n\nalong the docks to break down the equipment and tie off the boat. The sun \n\nis sinking beneath the horizon, and the gulls are settling down for the \n\nnight.\n\n\n\nMost of these soundscapes share quite a few layers, but I hope you can \n\nfeel the difference when you visualize them!\n\nLet me know which was your favorite place to 'dive'!",

(I recommend pumping up the Distant Thunder sliders to max volume.) The shortwave radio is optional; it feels a bit like desperately trying to hear the weather reports to figure out when everything will be over, but you can replace it with another sound or remove it entirely for a truly lonesome feel.\n\n[Storm Cellar](http://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=thunderNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D75757575752900000000&amp;g2=windNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D55442252594751332935&amp;g3=fireNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D56520000410000350000&amp;g4=demolitionWorkNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000000003619443100&amp;g5=shortwaveRadioTunerNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D3%26l%3D00000033000000001620%26a%3D4&amp;yt=)",
