Why? Because now that I've learned some new tricks, I've been able to execute the simple yet powerful concept I've had in mind much better than before. The most important change are the drums - while the *African Trance* (which I originally used) is a very good and versatile generator, it didn't really allow me to set the exact mood I was going for - I just settled for it back then due to lack of options when it comes to drum generators on myNoise. I knew, of course, about the beautiful taiko drum loop from *Cinematic East* (one of my favorite soundscapes on myNoise!) but it was just too fast and frenetic for the \"focused but relaxed\" state of mind that I had been trying to induce with this generator...\n\nWhat I didn't know was that I could have used note transposition to slow it down - which is exactly what I did now - and it makes all the difference!\n\nI used the same thing to alter the throat singing drone a little (achieving deeper and better sound IMO) and I also replaced the rain generator and added some subtle rainforest ambience. All in all, now it sounds the way I wanted it to sound from the start! :)\n\nP.S.: Here's the [**old version**](https://mynoise.net/superGenerator.php?g1=polyrhythmBeatGenerator.php%3Fc%3D1%26l%3D40205560004000000000%26a%3D1%26am%3D7%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;g2=throatSingingDroneGenerator.php%3Fc%3D1%26l%3D18304147504744403327%26a%3D1%26am%3D1%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;g3=rainNoiseGenerator.php%3Fc%3D1%26l%3D22130912263549514132%26a%3D1%26am%3D2%26m%3D%26d%3D0&amp;g4=&amp;g5=&amp;yt=) for anyone interested.",

I've slept to just these in combination the past few nights, and it's been really awesome, but I see the potential for adding more sound to this combo. There seems to be something faint that sounds like distant walking on something maybe slushy or metal, a crackling of beads or pebbles, and some kind of a windy element embedded into this combination already, so I could maybe imagine a bit of the fireplace generator, one of the wind or rain ones, the sky walker one, parts of Winter Walk or Polar Expedition, one of the running water or ocean generators, or even parts of the aircraft or that one whose name I can't remember off the top of my head that has the starship ambience going with this. The tonal quality of the initial combination has a lonely or serene feeling to it, so settings I've thought of so far have been a continuing voyage aboard a starship on a long or not urgent journey, an excursion using a spacesuit, either outside a starship or space station, or maybe being in temporary orbit of a planet, standing or sitting on a hostile or habitable planet with no life on it except for just you, flying in the skies of Earth or an imagined planet, barren rock, ice, or other landscape below, some kind of weather accompanying what ever it is one is doing on this planet... I'm glad I could share this, and I look forward to seeing where this initial start leads us in creating multi or supergens.",

I've ruled out my hardware, as it happens on my phone with earbuds, my macbook with headphones, and my desktop with speakers, all of them produce the same anomaly.\n\nI've tried a variety of things related to ensuring the browser isn't put into an idle mode.  I've tried different browsers.  I'm not sure what else to try, it kind of ruins the experience when there are clicks and skips in the middle of every noise. I'm trying some static exported recordings using my credits to see if it happens there.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this?  Chrome is my primary, but also hear it in Firefox. Thanks for any insight anyone can offer.",
